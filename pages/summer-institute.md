**Graduate students**: Ready to level-up your research and career options with new skills in data management, geospatial analysis, and digital storytelling? 
**Join the Library’s Summer Institute for Digital Inquiry, May 18-21, 2026!**

This 4-day intensive workshop is designed for Iowa State graduate students from all disciplines interested in learning foundational digital humanities theories, methods, and tools. 
You'll explore and critically evaluate existing digital projects, gain essential skills in data collection and management, and learn best practices for launching a digital project of your own. 
Participants will also gain hands-on experience with popular digital tools for text analysis, mapping, and digital storytelling.

Throughout the week, you'll have plenty of opportunities to collaborate and connect with fellow graduate students and lay the groundwork for ongoing collaborative funding opportunities with the library. 
**Coffee and lunch are provided** daily, and attendance costs are fully covered by the library. 

Interested applicants should prepare a statement of interest (no more than 500 words) describing interest in learning digital humanities methods and outlining any previous experience in this field (previous experience is not required).
